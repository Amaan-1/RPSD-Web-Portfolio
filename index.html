                    <p class="text-muted text-left txt-thing" style="font-family:  'Patrick Hand'; letter-spacing: 0.5px;">The catch phrase "it is not the technology, it is the teacher" has never been so true as it is with interactive whiteboards. An even truer phrase however would be "it is not just the teacher, it is the school". The school environment
                        needs to possess certain traits to ensure that interactive whiteboards can enhance teaching and learning within the school. Research is showing that in those schools where these traits do not exist the embedding of interactive
                        white boards is problematic and often ineffectual. RPS Dharuhera is blessed with this modern technique if inter exchanging knowledge from smart boards to teachers to students. The class is more entertaining, more exciting & more
                        learning.

                        RPS Schools owe their existence to Dr. O.P. Yadav, a noted lawyer and educationist, who aimed at creating and providing a global educational environment in his schools. He is one of the vision that an educated person has the ability to change the world
                        as he/she is brimming with confidence and zeal for making the right moves.
                        <br>
                        <br> Establishing and developing educational institutions is a passion of mine. If we realize that our country has issues that go beyond its borders and brand India is global now, then why do we continue with schools that have
                        only students and teachers. I strongly believe schools must invest in nurturing young children and give them an environment to learn and grow, which is why I set up world class schools. RPS, Dharuhera is the manifestation of our
                        desire. Here you will find facilities and infrastructure a child can use to expand their learning.
                        <br>
                        <br> We are a school community with high expectation, academic and otherwise. At the same time, we are always there to help students develop intellectual, artistic and personal interests contributing to their holistic growth. I
                        welcome parents and students to be a part of the RPS School family to share common ideals and aspirations as we build a challenging and enriching educational experience for our students.
